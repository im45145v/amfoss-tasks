# Debugging Derbies
this task is too pricky
but I enjoyed this task 
at first, I ran this program in an online compiler but it failed 
so then gotta know where to run
the easiest thing in this task is adding semi-colons? (;)
so now I want to explain how the thing is 

### syntax errors I faced are :
1)missing semi-colons;

2)missing braces/brackets ()

3)extra comments //

### typos:
1)multiply was wrongly written as multipy

### logical errors I faced:
1)unit conversion (1ms=0.01s)

2)arithmetic operations are misplaced

3)correct answers are decremented by 1 or incremented by -1

4)similarly wrong answers was incremented by +23


5)start & stop buttons are placed in opposite positions

## I hope that there are no more errors left in this file and those comment lines are really helpful as u said in the document
