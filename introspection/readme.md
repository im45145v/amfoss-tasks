# Introspection
## Why must we choose you?
i love exploring things in web which created me intrest in coding from then i love coding.but due to i'm an hostler i learnt only html,css and js. but now as its in my subject i'll learn it upto the far as i can .and if i'm in club then i can assist u and learn many things which will be helpful for me!  I'm socially super awkward. Spending time with different people might help me in various aspects. the thing i want to say is a loop i can't explain very well but i'll be helpfull if u choose me 

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
i selected ai as course so i'll many things there (more than cse students) and i'll learn as much as i can and i'll help all in the club so it improves my skills
and will larn java,c,python,one more thing. in this 6months as far as i can .so i'm sure that i'll give my efforts for this

## How would you contribute back to the club?

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
i don't have answer for this sorrry! 
it's the best way u can do nothing can satisfy me.so it's not u r fault
