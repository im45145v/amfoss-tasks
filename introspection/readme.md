# Introspection
## Why must we choose you?
I love exploring things on the web which created me interest in coding from then I love coding. but due to I'm a hostler I learned only HTML, CSS, and js. but now as it's in my subject I'll learn it up to as far as I can .and if I'm in club then I can assist u and learn many things which will be helpful for me!  I'm socially super awkward. Spending time with different people might help me in various aspects. the thing I want to say is a loop I can't explain very well but I'll be helpful if u choose me
